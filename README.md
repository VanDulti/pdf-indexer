## Introduction

This is a simple tool to generate a word index for a PDF file. The index is generated by extracting all words from the
PDF and counting the page numbers on which they appear. The index is then displayed in a table and can be downloaded in
various ways & formats.

## What is a word index?

A word index is a list of words that appear in a document, along with the page numbers on which they appear. It is used
to quickly find where a word appears in a document.

See [Wikipedia]("https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Register_(Nachschlagewerk)#Konkordanzen")

## Why?

Sometimes, Ctrl+F is not available. Think of a document you want to read on paper, this project resembles a way to
quickly find where a word appears in a document.

## Todo

- [x] Loading time indicators
    - [x] for index computation
    - [x] for PDF generation
- [x] File adding doesn't clear selection
- [x] File removal
- [x] Downloading of individual index
- [x] Downloading of individual PDF with the individual index appended to the end
